Paper Template
==============

A simple paper template.

### Requirements

This template requires [drawio](https://www.diagrams.net/) to be in `$PATH`.

#### Mac

Assume `~/bin` is in my `$PATH`.

```
❯ brew info drawio
❯ ln -s /Applications/draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/draw.io ~/bin/drawio 
```

### Credits

This template is inspired by and some parts are taken from [die](https://github.com/tsgates/die).

### TODOs
- Support for gnuplot and plots from python scripts
- pdftotext (including abstract.txt)
